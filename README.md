# [maltokyo/bisq](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-BISQ)
(Forked and adapted for Bisq from the awesome [linuxsever/calibre](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-calibre))


This is the docker version of the decentralised Bitcoin exchange [Bisq](https://bisq.network/).  Buy and sell bitcoin for fiat (or other cryptocurrencies) privately and securely using Bisq's peer-to-peer network and open-source desktop software. No registration required..

## Supported Architectures

The architectures supported by this image are:

| Architecture | Tag |
| :----: | --- |
| x86-64 | latest |

## Application Setup

This image sets up the BISQ desktop app and makes its interface available via Guacamole server in the browser. The interface is available at `http://your-ip:8080`.

By default, there is no password set for the main gui. Optional environment variable `PASSWORD` will allow setting a password for the user `abc`.

Port 8081 is reserved for BISQ's built-in webserver, which can be enabled within the desktop app settings, and the internal port must be set to `8081` although it will then be available at the host mapped port for external access.

You can access advanced features of the Guacamole remote desktop using `ctrl`+`alt`+`shift` enabling you to use remote copy/paste and different languages.

## Usage

Here are some example snippets to help you get started creating a container.

### docker-compose ([recommended](https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/docker-compose))

Compatible with docker-compose v2 schemas - see sample file included, copy and make your own.


### docker cli (might be outdated, check the docker-compose.yml file for latest variables etc)

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name=BISQ \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -e TZ=Europe/London \
  -e PASSWORD= `#optional` \
  -e CLI_ARGS= `#optional` \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -p 8081:8081 \
  -v /path/to/data:/config \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/linuxserver/BISQ
```

## Parameters

Container images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate `<external>:<internal>` respectively. For example, `-p 8080:80` would expose port `80` from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port `8080` outside the container.

| Parameter | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `-p 8080` | BISQ desktop gui. |
| `-e PUID=1000` | for UserID - see below for explanation |
| `-e PGID=1000` | for GroupID - see below for explanation |
| `-e TZ=Europe/London` | Specify a timezone to use EG Europe/London. |
| `-e PASSWORD=` | Optionally set a password for the gui. |
| `-e CLI_ARGS=` | Optionally pass cli start arguments to BISQ. |
| `-v /config` | Where BISQ should store its database and library. |

## Environment variables from files (Docker secrets)

You can set any environment variable from a file by using a special prepend `FILE__`.

As an example:

```bash
-e FILE__PASSWORD=/run/secrets/mysecretpassword
```

Will set the environment variable `PASSWORD` based on the contents of the `/run/secrets/mysecretpassword` file.

## Umask for running applications

For all of our images we provide the ability to override the default umask settings for services started within the containers using the optional `-e UMASK=022` setting.
Keep in mind umask is not chmod it subtracts from permissions based on it's value it does not add. Please read up [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask) before asking for support.

## User / Group Identifiers

When using volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`.

Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic.

In this instance `PUID=1000` and `PGID=1000`, to find yours use `id user` as below:

```bash
  $ id username
    uid=1000(dockeruser) gid=1000(dockergroup) groups=1000(dockergroup)
```
